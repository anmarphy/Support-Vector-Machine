# Support-Vector-Machine
This collection of Jupyter notebooks contains an excerpt of the chapter In-Depth: Support Vector Machines from the book the Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. An amazing book wich explains the theorical concepts as well as provide the coding scripts, I really recommend this book :)
